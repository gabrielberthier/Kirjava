From disassembling and reassembling computer and electronic parts to writing music that no one would listen to, the growing creativity made me pursue some of my main passions today: writing, composing, designing software architectures and developing. I've dedicated a good part of my life to the Computing Area, having achieved some great moments in my career, such as participating in the Erasmus+ Project, my first jobs and the development of Augmented Reality applications - one of which is my CBT project: )</p><br><p>As a software developer, I have worked for some companies, such as Zappts, IBM and, currently, DM, which have always welcomed me very well and where I left goals accomplished and new companions. In these places I got to know and delve deeper into the Cloud environment, automation, I became an - excellent - Python developer and every now and then I found myself giving suggestions on the architecture of these projects, which led me to new goals, some completed, others still to be completed, such as be an AWS Solutions Architect. </p><br><p>A little more than that, although I have a bachelor's degree in Information Systems, I always dreamed of authoring my own works and transmitting their thoughts - sometimes so abstract - in text. From an early age I found myself surrounded by books, texts and writings, growing up accompanied by collections of authors that I still hold dear, such as Florbela Espanca, Fernando Pessoa, Paulo Leminski and Gon√ßalves Dias, who influenced me from writing to the very way I see the world . </p><br><p>Personally, I live life with a laptop, long goals and the most beautiful daughter I could ever dream of. </p>"
